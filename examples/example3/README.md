# Example 3

> Typical project style: DDD, Clean architecture, Hexagonale.

More complicated case: domain model `User` differs from database (one domain model stored in two tables).

File `./adapters/mysql/user_repo.go` is crafted by hands to unite two generated repo in one.

## Generate

Repo file generated by:

```bash
$ goqu-crud-gen -model User -table user -dialect mysql 
```

Generated file will contain `go:generate` instruction.
